        <p class="conTent">
            JavaScriptÂ® (often shortened to JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with first-class
            functions,
            and is best known as the scripting language for Web pages, but it's used in many non-browser environments as
            well.
            It is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm scripting language that is dynamic,
            and supports object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.
